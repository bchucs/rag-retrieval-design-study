Specifically, CPFSMs model transitions as probability distributions over states, allowing for the representation of uncertainty and variability in character behavior during role-playing scenarios.

This probabilistic approach enables CPFSMs to better handle the complexities and open-ended nature of role-playing interactions, as it can account for multiple potential outcomes from a given state rather than a single, fixed transition. The introduction of this probabilistic modeling is a significant enhancement over the traditional CFSMs, which may struggle to adapt to the stochastic elements inherent in role-playing environments.

q_041,What role does optimism play in stabilizing Thompson sampling according to the study?,exp1_topk_1,True,2602.06014v1,1.0,"According to the study presented in ""Optimism Stabilizes Thompson Sampling for Adaptive Inference,"" optimism plays a crucial role in restoring stability to Thompson sampling (TS) in the context of stochastic multi-armed bandits. The authors identify optimism as a key mechanism that ensures the stability required for valid asymptotic inference, which is necessary when dealing with adaptive data collection where arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule.

The paper demonstrates that optimism can be implemented in two ways: 

1. **Variance-Inflated Thompson Sampling**: The authors prove that this method is stable for any number of arms \( K \ge 2 \), extending previous results from a two-armed setting to a general \( K \)-armed setting. This addresses an open question raised by Halder et al. (2025) regarding the stability of TS.

2. **Alternative Optimistic Modification**: This approach maintains the posterior variance but adds an explicit mean bonus to the posterior mean. The authors establish that this modification also leads to the same stability conclusion.

In summary, optimism helps to ensure that each arm's pull count concentrates around a deterministic scale, which is essential for achieving asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits while only incurring a mild additional regret cost.","Optimism is identified as a key mechanism for restoring stability in Thompson sampling, which is necessary for valid asymptotic inference in multi-armed bandits.

Key trends identified in the paper include:

1. **Automation of Hardware Mapping**: The introduction of an evolutionary, hardware-in-the-loop mapping framework signifies a move towards automating the deployment of neural networks on specialized hardware, which can enhance accessibility for users.

2. **Efficiency Improvements**: The reported results show a 35% reduction in total latency and a 40% improvement in energy efficiency when using the proposed method compared to default heuristics. This indicates a trend towards optimizing both performance and energy consumption in AI hardware.

3. **Scalability**: The framework's scalability to multi-chip systems suggests a growing trend in AI hardware towards leveraging distributed architectures to handle larger and more complex models efficiently.

However, the paper does not provide a comprehensive overview of all current trends in AI hardware, such as developments in other types of accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs), advancements in chip design, or emerging technologies like quantum computing.

q_060,What is RISE-Video and what does it aim to achieve in the context of generative video models?,exp1_topk_1,True,2602.05986v1,1.0,"RISE-Video is a pioneering benchmark designed for evaluating generative video models, specifically in the context of Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) synthesis. Its primary aim is to assess the ability of these models to internalize and reason over implicit world rules, moving beyond mere visual fidelity to focus on deep cognitive reasoning. 

The benchmark consists of 467 human-annotated samples across eight categories, providing a structured testbed for evaluating model intelligence in various dimensions, including commonsense reasoning, spatial dynamics, and specialized subject domains. RISE-Video introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol that includes four key metrics: 

1. **Reasoning Alignment** - assessing how well the generated content aligns with logical reasoning.
2. **Temporal Consistency** - evaluating the coherence of events over time in the generated video.
3. **Physical Rationality** - measuring the adherence of the generated content to physical laws and constraints.
4. **Visual Quality** - focusing on the aesthetic aspects of the generated video.

To facilitate scalable evaluation, RISE-Video also proposes an automated pipeline that utilizes Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to simulate human-centric assessments. The extensive experiments conducted on 11 state-of-the-art TI2V models revealed significant deficiencies in these models' abilities to simulate complex scenarios under implicit constraints, highlighting areas for improvement in future generative models.

Their primary purpose is to facilitate efficient and accurate reward alignment in generative models at inference time. Traditional flow and diffusion models, while capable of producing high-quality samples, often struggle with adapting to user preferences or constraints after training, a challenge known as reward alignment.

The key innovation of Diamond Maps is that they are designed to incorporate efficient reward alignment as an intrinsic property of the generative model itself, rather than treating it as an afterthought. This design allows Diamond Maps to amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, similar to flow maps, while still maintaining the necessary stochasticity for optimal reward alignment. This capability enhances the scalability of search, sequential Monte Carlo methods, and guidance by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function.

The experiments conducted in the study demonstrate that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently through distillation from GLASS Flows, outperforming existing methods in terms of reward alignment performance and scalability. Overall, Diamond Maps represent a practical advancement in creating generative models that can be rapidly adapted to various preferences and constraints during inference.","Diamond Maps are stochastic flow map models designed to enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time.

The findings indicate that while larger, instruction-tuned models tend to show higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses can vary significantly across different questions. Some questions lead to total agreement among models, while others result in divergent answers, suggesting that language-specific behavior is present in consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only for certain questions. This highlights the need for further investigation into the selective effects of preference fine-tuning on LLM responses.","The paper investigates whether multilingual LLMs are consistent in their responses across languages, behaving like theoretical polyglots, or if they respond differently depending on the language of the question, akin to a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values.",2.0,False,0.0,51.698923110961914,5318.115234375,5369.856119155884

q_093,What is the main finding regarding variance-inflated Thompson sampling in the context of adaptive data collection?,exp1_topk_1,True,2602.06014v1,1.0,"The main finding regarding variance-inflated Thompson sampling (TS) in the context of adaptive data collection is that it is stable for any number of arms \( K \ge 2 \). This stability is crucial because it allows for valid asymptotic inference despite the complexities introduced by adaptive data collection, where arm-specific sample sizes are random and influenced by the action-selection rule. The paper demonstrates that optimism serves as a key mechanism for restoring stability, which is necessary for ensuring that each arm's pull count concentrates around a deterministic scale. This finding extends the results from the two-armed setting discussed by Halder et al. (2025) to the more general \( K \)-armed setting, thereby resolving an open question in the literature. Additionally, the paper analyzes an alternative optimistic modification that maintains the posterior variance while adding a mean bonus to the posterior mean, achieving the same stability conclusion. Overall, the implementation of optimism in TS allows for asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits with only a mild additional regret cost.","The study proves that variance-inflated Thompson sampling is stable for any number of arms K, including cases where multiple arms are optimal.
