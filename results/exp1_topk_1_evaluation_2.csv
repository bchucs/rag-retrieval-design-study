GPEReg-Net achieves this by separating domain-invariant scene features from domain-specific appearance codes using Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN). This separation allows for direct image-to-image registration without the need for explicit deformation field estimation, which is a limitation of existing registration methods that rely on brightness constancy assumptions.

Additionally, GPEReg-Net incorporates a Global Position Encoding (GPE) module that enhances the model's ability to exploit temporal structure in sequential acquisitions. This module combines learnable position embeddings with sinusoidal encoding and cross-frame attention, enabling the network to utilize context from neighboring frames to improve temporal coherence.

The performance of GPEReg-Net is validated on the OR-PAM-Reg-4K benchmark, where it achieves notable metrics: a Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) of 0.953, a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.932, and a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 34.49 dB. These results surpass the state-of-the-art by 3.8% in SSIM and 1.99 dB in PSNR, while maintaining competitive NCC values.

1. **Belief-Based Methods**: Traditional belief-based methods primarily rely on past experiences to estimate the state of the system. However, they often do not fully utilize global information, which can lead to suboptimal decision-making and coordination among agents. GlobeDiff, on the other hand, formulates the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, allowing it to leverage both local observations and global information effectively. This results in a more accurate inference of the global state, overcoming ambiguities that belief-based methods struggle with.

This is achieved through the following steps:

1. **Calibration of Surrogate Signals**: The framework first calibrates a surrogate signal to reference labels using an offline labeled sample. This involves using a method called **score bucketing**, where model scores are discretized into buckets.

2. **Estimation of Bucket-Level Prevalences**: From the offline labeled sample, the framework estimates the prevalence of each bucket. This means that for each bucket, the proportion of instances that fall into that bucket is calculated based on the reference labels.

3. **Combining with Impression Logs**: Once the bucket-level prevalences are established, the framework uses impression logs from the A/B tests to determine the distribution of impressions across the different buckets for each experiment arm. 

4. **Log-Based Estimates**: By combining the calibrated bucket-level prevalences with the bucket distribution of impressions, the framework can quickly estimate the overall prevalence for arbitrary experiment arms and segments without the need for per-experiment labeling jobs.

Specifically, MFLI enhances the retrieval process by:

1. **Unified Learning Framework**: MFLI learns multifaceted item embeddings and indices within a single framework, addressing the limitation of separate training stages for embeddings and indexing that can lead to suboptimal retrieval quality, especially for newly created items.

2. **Elimination of ANN Search at Serving Time**: By constructing a multifaceted hierarchical codebook through residual quantization of item embeddings and co-training it with the embeddings, MFLI avoids the need for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search during serving time. This significantly reduces computational costs associated with running ANN for every request.

3. **Real-time Updates**: MFLI introduces an efficient multifaceted indexing structure that supports real-time updates, which is crucial for maintaining the relevance of recommendations as new items are added.

4. **Performance Improvements**: The paper reports extensive experimental results showing that MFLI improves recall on engagement tasks by up to 11.8%, cold-content delivery by up to 57.29%, and semantic relevance by 13.5% compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, CAFE employs a two-phase framework where Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph (DAG) over features and the target, allowing it to establish soft causal priors. This causal structure helps in grouping features based on their direct, indirect, or other causal influences with respect to the target.

In Phase II, CAFE utilizes a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators. This phase incorporates hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that prioritize causally plausible transformations while managing feature complexity. As a result, CAFE is able to produce more robust features that are less sensitive to distribution shifts.

The paper reports that under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces the performance drop by approximately 4 times relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline. This significant improvement is attributed to the use of causal structure as a soft inductive prior, which enhances the robustness and efficiency of the automated feature engineering process, leading to more stable post-hoc attributions and more compact feature sets.

CaR is designed to improve the generation of diverse and high-quality solutions through a joint training framework that effectively guides the construction module. This results in a significant reduction in the number of steps required for solution improvement—10 steps compared to the 5,000 steps typically needed in prior work. Additionally, CaR introduces a construction-improvement-shared representation, which facilitates knowledge sharing across different paradigms by unifying the encoder, particularly in complex constrained scenarios.

The evaluation of CaR on typical hard routing constraints demonstrates its superior performance in terms of feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency when compared to both classical and state-of-the-art neural solvers.","The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of Construct-and-Refine (CaR), an efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers that uses explicit learning-based feasibility refinement.

1. **Sample Complexity**: The GMFS framework achieves a sample complexity of \(\mathrm{poly}(κ)\), where \(κ\) represents the number of agents subsampled based on interaction strength. This polynomial relationship indicates that the number of samples required to learn an effective policy grows at a manageable rate as the number of agents increases. This is crucial in large-scale MARL scenarios, where the joint state-action space can become prohibitively large, making traditional methods infeasible. By ensuring that the sample complexity is polynomial, GMFS allows for scalable learning in environments with many agents.

2. **Optimality Gap**: The optimality gap of \(O(1/\sqrt{κ})\) signifies that as the number of subsampled agents increases, the performance of the learned policy approaches the optimal policy. This rate of convergence is beneficial because it implies that with a relatively small increase in the number of agents considered, the performance can be significantly improved. The \(O(1/\sqrt{κ})\) optimality gap suggests that the framework is not only efficient but also effective in approximating the optimal solution, which is particularly important in cooperative settings where agents must work together to achieve a common goal.

In summary, the GMFS framework's polynomial sample complexity and favorable optimality gap make it a promising approach for scalable and effective learning in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, as demonstrated in the numerical simulations for robotic coordination.

Specifically, the paper highlights the following key factors:

1. **Inductive Biases**: The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the inductive biases that govern learning and generalization in LLMs. The authors note that the emergent misalignment (EM) phenomenon reveals how these biases can lead to unexpected generalization behaviors, such as models producing stereotypically 'evil' responses when finetuned on narrowly harmful datasets.

2. **Representation of Solutions**: The research identifies that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment. This suggests that the structure of the learned representations plays a crucial role in how well the model generalizes beyond the specific tasks it was trained on. The existence of a linear representation for both general and narrow solutions indicates that the nature of these representations can influence generalization error.

3. **Loss Functions**: The introduction of a KL divergence loss to learn the narrow solution representation is another factor that affects generalization. The comparison of losses between general misalignment and narrow solutions shows that general misalignment achieves lower loss, which correlates with better robustness to perturbations and greater influence in the pre-training distribution.

4. **Robustness to Perturbations**: The paper finds that general misalignment is more robust to perturbations compared to narrow solutions. This robustness is likely to contribute to lower generalization error, as models that can withstand variations in input are generally better at generalizing to unseen data.

5. **Pre-training Distribution Influence**: The influence of the pre-training distribution on the learned representations is also a significant factor. The findings suggest that representations that align more closely with the pre-training distribution may lead to better generalization performance.

In summary, the factors influencing generalization error according to this research include inductive biases, the nature of learned representations, the choice of loss functions, robustness to perturbations, and the influence of the pre-training distribution.

This finding underscores the persistent gaps in bilingual reasoning and the difficulties LLMs face in transferring domain knowledge across languages.

These findings emphasize the importance of developing robust evaluation frameworks like IndicEval to address the complexities of multilingual educational assessments and to improve the adaptability of LLMs in diverse linguistic settings.","The experiments revealed three major findings: CoT prompting improves reasoning accuracy, significant cross-model performance disparities exist in high-complexity examinations, and there is a critical challenge in multilingual performance, with accuracy in Hindi dropping compared to English, especially under Zero-Shot conditions.",2.0,False,0.0,57.06524848937988,5277.658700942993,5334.756851196289
