Traditional supervised models typically focus on maximizing performance on in-domain datasets, which can lead to overfitting on dataset-specific definitions of hate speech. This results in limited robustness when faced with domain shifts or annotation noise.

In contrast, xList-Hate employs a checklist-based framework that decomposes hate speech detection into explicit, concept-level questions grounded in normative criteria. Each question is answered independently by a large language model (LLM), producing binary diagnostic signals that capture features of hateful content without directly predicting the final label. These signals are then aggregated using a lightweight, fully interpretable decision tree, which allows for transparent and auditable predictions.

The framework's approach enhances cross-dataset robustness and relative performance under domain shifts, as evidenced by evaluations across multiple hate speech benchmarks. Additionally, xList-Hate provides fine-grained interpretability through explicit decision paths and factor-level analysis, which is not typically available in traditional supervised models.

Unlike prior work, which often relies on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard critical information relevant to specific queries, BudgetMem structures memory processing into a set of memory modules categorized into three budget tiers (Low, Mid, High). This tiered approach allows for a more flexible and efficient allocation of memory resources based on the specific demands of the task at hand.

Additionally, BudgetMem employs a lightweight router that performs budget-tier routing across these modules, balancing task performance with memory construction costs. This routing mechanism is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning, which enhances the system's adaptability and efficiency compared to previous methods that may incur substantial overhead and offer limited control over the performance-cost trade-off.

The empirical results across various benchmarks (LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA) demonstrate that BudgetMem not only surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (in high-budget settings) but also achieves better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budget constraints.

CFSMs utilize a framework that automatically codifies textual character profiles into finite-state machines, extracting key states and transitions to produce interpretable structures that enforce character consistency. This approach is effective in capturing the deterministic aspects of character interactions in role-playing scenarios.

In contrast, CPFSMs extend the CFSM framework by incorporating probabilistic elements into the transition modeling. Instead of having fixed transitions between states, CPFSMs model these transitions as probability distributions over states. This allows CPFSMs to better capture uncertainty and variability in character interactions, making them more suitable for open-ended and stochastic state exploration in role-playing contexts.

Thus, the key difference lies in the transition modeling: CFSMs are deterministic, while CPFSMs introduce a probabilistic approach to account for uncertainty in state transitions (as described in Paper 1).","Codified Probabilistic Finite-State Machines (CPFSMs) extend CFSMs by modeling transitions as probability distributions over states, which helps to capture uncertainty and variability.

Furthermore, the features extracted by SAEs in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming steering methods used in LLMs. This suggests that SAEs not only enhance interpretability but also improve the model's performance in DLMs by providing useful signals for decoding and maintaining stability during the post-training phase.

In the context of the research presented in the papers, particularly in Paper 1, NLBP is formalized as a method that guarantees the same consistency constraint as the linear case, which is represented by the equation \( x' = x + A^\dagger(y - Ax) \) for linear systems. 

In the case of non-linear mappings, the NLBP method extends the concept of the Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse (PInv) to a non-linear regime, allowing for the projection of a sample \( x \) to its closest consistent state \( x' \) that satisfies the non-linear relationship \( f(x) = y \).

q_094,What are the latest algorithms published in 2023 that outperform traditional models?,exp1_topk_3,False,2602.04529v1|2602.03840v1|2602.05986v1,0.0,"The provided papers do not explicitly mention specific algorithms published in 2023 that outperform traditional models. However, they do introduce innovative frameworks and methods that represent advancements in their respective fields.

1. **Paper 1** discusses a framework for automated algorithm design that combines Genetic Programming (GP) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently discover algorithms for real-world optimization problems. This method allows for deep exploration of the algorithmic space while significantly reducing the need for costly evaluations, suggesting that it could outperform traditional methods that rely heavily on extensive evaluations.

2. **Paper 2** presents the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Quantum Circuits (EXAQC), which utilizes neuro-evolution and genetic programming to design parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). The preliminary results indicate that circuits evolved using this method achieve over 90% accuracy on benchmark datasets, which may suggest a performance advantage over traditional circuit design methods.

3. **Paper 3** introduces RISE-Video, a benchmark for evaluating generative video models based on their reasoning capabilities rather than just visual fidelity. While it does not present a new algorithm that outperforms traditional models, it highlights the deficiencies of existing models in simulating complex scenarios, indicating a need for improved approaches in generative modeling.

In summary, while the papers present novel frameworks and methods that could potentially outperform traditional models, they do not provide specific algorithms or comparative performance metrics against traditional models. More detailed empirical results or comparisons would be necessary to definitively identify algorithms that outperform traditional models.",I don't have enough information in the provided documents to answer this question.,2.0,False,1.0,48.578739166259766,8309.836864471436,8358.45398902893
q_095,How does DyTopo enhance the communication between agents during problem-solving?,exp1_topk_3,True,2602.06039v1|2602.06008v1,1.0,"DyTopo enhances communication between agents during problem-solving by implementing a dynamic topology routing framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round of interaction. This approach is guided by a manager that sets specific goals for each round, allowing agents to output lightweight natural-language query (need) and key (offer) descriptors. DyTopo then embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching to route private messages only along the edges of the induced communication graph.

This method contrasts with traditional fixed communication patterns, which may not align with the evolving needs of iterative problem-solving. By adapting the communication pathways based on the current round's objectives, DyTopo improves the efficiency and relevance of agent interactions. The framework not only enhances accuracy—demonstrated by an average performance improvement of +6.2 over strong baselines across various benchmarks—but also provides an interpretable coordination trace through the evolving graphs, allowing for qualitative inspection of how communication pathways change over time (as detailed in Paper 1).","DyTopo enhances communication by employing semantic matching to route private messages only along the induced edges of a dynamically reconstructed communication graph, which adapts based on the manager's round goal.

It aims to evaluate language-mediated economic interactions among multiple agents, addressing the limitations of existing benchmarks that do not adequately support such evaluations. AgenticPay models markets where buyers and sellers have private constraints and product-dependent valuations, requiring them to reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than relying solely on numeric bidding. The framework encompasses over 110 diverse tasks, including bilateral bargaining and many-to-many markets, and includes structured action extraction and metrics for assessing feasibility, efficiency, and welfare in negotiations. This establishes AgenticPay as a foundational tool for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interactions.","The primary purpose of the AgenticPay framework is to provide a benchmark and simulation framework for multi-agent buyer-seller negotiation driven by natural language, enabling the evaluation of language-mediated economic interactions among multiple agents.",2.0,False,0.0,58.34698677062988,4279.925107955933,4338.312149047852
